                        Terraform is a cloud-agnostic Infrastructure-as-Code tool. I have built solutions using Terraform for GCP, AWS, and Azure. I am proficient in other Terraform related HashiCorp tools, such as Terraform Cloud and Terraform Sentinel. Terraform is one of my favorite tools, and really enables DevOps practices such as automation and collaboration.
